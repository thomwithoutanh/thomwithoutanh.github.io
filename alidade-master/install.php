Our research suggests that trying a tool out will improve your chances of success.</p><p>This step guides you through three tasks: </p><ul><li><b>Planning a trial for your tool</b>. Even if you\'ve decided to build a new tool, try some existing tools first: you will learn more about what your tool needs to do.

Hearing what the tool is really like to use - and whether the users actually want to use it - will test your key assumptions.</p>\n<p>In general, the more thoroughly you trial, the more prepared you will be. However, you may not be able to put aside the time for detailed trials. If your resources are limited, our research suggests that it is better to hold a short, simple trial than none at all. Getting feedback from a carefully selected group of target users does not have to take much time, and it could pay dividends later on.</p>\n<blockquote>\nCase Study: \"[Our original] tool did not work, but we rebuilt it based on learnings: and that [new tool] is working and being implemented.\"\n</blockquote>\n<p>It\'s also crucial to make sure that the people who test it are the same as the people you want to use the tool. </p>\nTrying it out yourself (or with people like you) will still be useful, but you might miss important differences between what you want and what your users want. Several projects found these differences in implementation, but only realised it too late. <p></p>\n<blockquote>Case Study: A member of one organisation, reflecting on the fact that few people used the platform they had developed, said: \"Treating myself as a typical test user was a mistake. Testing [it] with users before the launch would have pointed out many of the flaws.\"</blockquote>\n',3,1),(22,3,'Planning a trial','\n<p>A good trial lets you get to the key decisions quickly: keep it simple and tightly focused. </p>\n<h3>Time</h3> \n<p>Set a limit on the time that you trial each tool, depending on the complexity of the tool. A simple social media tool could be trialled in two hours if only one person is using it, but a system to collect complaints submitted online and by telephone in three regions will take longer because there is more to test (users from different regions will need to trial it, and more technical things could go wrong). </p>\n<h3>Choosing your test users</h3>\n<p>Pick a small group of people who have characteristics similar to the people you want to use the tool. Ideally, these should be people you know well and have worked with before. Make sure they understand the basics of how to use the tool before starting the trial, and note any things that they find difficult to understand. </p>\n<h3>Find simple ways of trialling tools</h3>\n<h4>Existing tools </h4>\n<p>Some software is available for free or on a \'freemium\' package (where you only pay for high levels of usage). Even programmes that you buy outright usually have a free trial version.</p> \n<h4>Tools you are building yourself</h4>\n<p>Even if you have decided to build a new tool from scratch, try to trial a similar existing tool before you make the final decision.

However, the technical partner organisation managed the entire process, and when the project ended the organisation was unable to continue it themselves. </blockquote>\n\n<p>Think about what could go wrong in advance, and raise issues before you agree to work together.
