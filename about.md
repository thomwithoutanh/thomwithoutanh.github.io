I research complex and opaque systems, and how they affect people and the environment.

From anonymously owned companies illegally cutting down rainforests to algorithms that governments use to identify vulnerable people, these systems have major impacts.

I believe that we need to scrutinise them in depth. 


## My background

I specialise in work focused on transparency and accountability, particularly related to forests, land rights and AI. I'm also particularly interested in how civil society organisations can use technology more effectively. 

Over the last ten years, I've worked in more than 17 countries, and interviewed people from over 300 organisations. Here are some [projects I've worked on](/projects){:target="_blank"}. 

I'm an experienced editor, and have worked at think tanks, newspapers and a range of human rights organisations.
