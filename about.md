## My focus

I focus on how complex, opaque systems affect ordinary people. From the anonymous ownership structures that help companies cut down rainforests in south-east Asia, to the algorithmic decision-making systems that allow governments to identify vulnerable people, I believe that these systems need to be scrutinised rigorously.


how complex systems designed by governments and companies affect people, and what those people can do to influence it. 

I'm particular

 environmental justice, transparency and accountability, land rights, and anti-corruption investigations.
