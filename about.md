## My background

I specialise in work focused on transparency and accountability, particularly related to forests, land rights and AI. I'm also particularly interested in how civil society organisations can use technology to support their work. 

Over the last ten years, I've worked in more than 17 countries, and interviewed people from over 300 organisations. Here are some [projects I've worked on](/projects){:target="_blank"}.
